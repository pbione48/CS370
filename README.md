## Reflection – CS 370 Module Eight Journal

### Work Completed
For this project, I implemented a reinforcement learning agent (the pirate) to navigate a maze and find treasure. The starter code provided the maze environment (`TreasureMaze.py`) and experience replay structure (`GameExperience.py`). I created the Deep Q-Learning components, including the training loop (`qtrain`), evaluation, and visualizations of the pirate’s path. I also managed model checkpoints and trained the agent until it consistently solved the maze.

### Connection to Computer Science
Computer scientists design, test, and refine solutions that apply computational thinking to real-world problems. This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can solve sequential decision problems, which is a foundation for robotics, gaming AI, and autonomous systems. It matters because these same principles power technologies like self-driving cars, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.

### Problem-Solving Approach
As a computer scientist, I approached the problem by breaking it into pieces: defining the environment, designing the agent, and implementing the learning algorithm. I iterated through debugging, training in smaller chunks, and validating results. I relied on systematic experimentation (adjusting epochs, replay buffer, epsilon) rather than guessing, which mirrors real-world engineering practice.

### Ethical Responsibilities
My responsibility is to ensure intelligent agents are used ethically. AI must not create harm through bias or unsafe decisions. For example, reinforcement learning agents trained in the real world must consider human safety and transparency. As a developer, I must communicate limitations clearly and prioritize the end user’s well-being while aligning solutions with organizational goals.
